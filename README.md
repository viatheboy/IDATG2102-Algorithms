Language used: C++.

This repository consists of the coding assignments delivered in the course. There was a total of six assignments, but only two were actual programming tasks. Additionally, some non-graded, regular programming tasks are included in the repository.Â¨
<br> I have added my solution for the programming parts of our 4 hour sitting exam from December 2023. The task description is provided in the files themselves, and the corresponding code is what I generated myself during the enclosed exam.<br>Grade: B.
<br>Unless specified in the program files, task descriptions are not available for assignments and tasks.
